# RL_M
Larn - maintained and developed for modern systems

# Supported Systems

* GNU/Linux 64bit only (compiled on CentOS8)
* macOS Catalina ~
* Windows 64bit (compiled on MinGW 64bit)

~ macOS Catalina may have support dropped.  I really hate the restrictions placed upon binaries and having to add Larn everytime to the security settings is simply stupid.

# Changes

* I will be taking my old changes the caused friction in the community and implementing them
  as they were in Larn 12.3.

# Fixes

* Numerous crashes, random segfaults have been fixed, the game is completely stable.
* Updates to gameplay will be done if / when there is a need and as long as it doesn't
  affect the core gameplay.
