# RL_M
Larn - maintained and developed for modern systems

# Supported Systems

* GNU/Linux 64bit only (compiled on CentOS8)
* macOS Catalina ~
* Windows 64bit (compiled on MinGW 64bit)

~ macOS Catalina may have support dropped.  I really hate the restrictions placed upon binaries and having to add Larn everytime to the security settings is simply stupid.
