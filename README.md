# RL_M
Larn - maintained and developed for modern systems

# Supported Systems

* GNU/Linux
* macOS
* Windows

# Changes

* I will be taking my old changes the caused friction in the community and implementing them
  as they were in Larn 12.3.

# Fixes

* Numerous crashes, random segfaults have been fixed, the game is completely stable.
* Updates to gameplay will be done if / when there is a need and as long as it doesn't
  affect the core gameplay.

# Building

* For GNU/Linux systems, go into the 'src' directory and type 'make prep' and the 'make'.
Afterwards, ./larn will run the game and all files are saved into your user ~/.larn directory.

* For Windows, MinGW is a requirement, the same process applies.

# Notes
On macOS, as I am not part of the Developer Program, I cannot sign the binary to allow gatekeeper to execute it.  You will need admin rights on your mac to allow for 'unidentified developers'.
