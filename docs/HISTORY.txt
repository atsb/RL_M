This file explains the historical nature of this Larn repository.

This repository contains the Larn sourcecode which can trace it's ancestry back to the original 12.0 release from 1986.
If you check the CHANGELOG.txt, you will see the additions made throughout the decades.

Since I am committed to maintaining Larn for the foreseeable future, eventually code will be rewritten and I expect
eventually in the future that nearly none of the original code would be left.
